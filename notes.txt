*** INTRODUCTION ***

NEAT = NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies

Objective : Evolving both weights and the topology.

GA = Generic Algorithms

TWEANN = Topology and Weight Evolving Artificial Neural Networks

TWEANNs can be divided between those that use a direct encoding, and those that use an indirect one

=> Direct encoding schemes, employed by most TWEANNs, specify in the genome every connection and node that will appear in the phenotype 

=> In contrast, indirect encodings usually only specify rules for constructing a phenotype.

GNARL = GeNeralized Acquisition of Recurrent Links
=> No crossovers

In NEAT, we chose direct encoding.

*** COMPETING CONVENTIONS ***

Competing Convention Problem (= Permuations Problem) :
[A, B, C] X [C, B, A] => [A, B, A] and [C, B, C], both missing information.

Gene amplification = adding new genes to a genome

Homology = two genes are homologous if they are alleles of the same trait. 

In NEAT, historical origin of two genes is direct evidence of homology if the genes share the same origin

*** PROTECTING INNOVATION ***

In TWEANNs, innovation takes place by adding new structure to networks through mutation. Adding a new connection can reduce fitness before its weight has a chance to optimize.

In nature, different structures tend to be in different species that compete in different niches.

However, because NEAT has a solution to the competing conventions problem,
using historical information about genes, the population in NEAT can easily be speciated.

We use "explicit fitness sharing", which forces individuals with similar genomes to share their fitness payoff => prevents one species from taking all population

*** INITIAL POPULATION & TOPOLOGICAL INNOVATION ***

In many TWEANN systems, the initial population is a collection of random topologies. But starting out with random topologies does not lead to finding minimal solutions, since the population starts out with many unnecessary nodes and connections already present.

One way to force minimal topologies is to incorporate network size into the fitness
function, and some TWEANNs actually do this.

Starting out with a minimal population and growing structure from there is a design principle in NEAT. By starting out minimally, NEAT ensures that the system searches for the solution in the lowest-dimensional weight space possible over the course of all generations.

The goal is not to minimize only the final product, but all intermediate networks
along the way as well.

*** THE NEAT METHOD ***

Genotype = the string
Phenotype = the network

Each genome includes a list of connection genes, each of which refers to two node genes being connected.

Node genes provide a list of inputs, hidden nodes, and outputs that can be connected

Each connection gene specifies 
 - the in-node, 
 - the out-node, 
 - the weight of the connection, 
 - whether or not the connection gene is expressed (an enable bit), 
 - an innovation number, which allows finding corresponding genes.

Mutation in NEAT can change both connection weights and network structures.

2 types of structural mutations : 
 - Adding a connection between two nodes (random weigth)
 - Adding a node (an existing connection is split in two). The old connection is disabled. The 1st new connection has a weight of 1 and the other has the same as the old connection.

Through mutation, the genomes in NEAT will gradually get larger.

When crossing over, the genes in both genomes with the same innovation numbers are lined up. These genes are called matching genes.

Genes that do not match are either disjoint or excess, depending on whether they occur within or outside the range of the other parentâ€™s innovation numbers.

> A and B two different genomes.
> matching genes = genes with the same innovation number in A and B
> excess genes = genes that are outside the other gene innovation numbers
> disjoint genes = genes that do not match

In composing the offspring, genes are randomly chosen from either parent at matching genes, whereas all excess or disjoint genes are always included from the more fit parent.

*** SPECIALISATION ***

Because smaller structures optimize faster than larger structures, and adding nodes and connections usually initially decreases the fitness of the network, recently augmented structures have little hope of surviving => Need for specialisation

The number of excess and disjoint genes between a pair of genomes is a natural
measure of their compatibility distance. 

distance between two genomes :

delta = c1 * E / N + c2 * D / N + c3 * W

with E the number of excess genes
     D the number of disjoint genes
     W the average weight difference of matching genes
     N the number of genes il the larger genome (for normalization)

We use a compatibility threshold "delta_limit" to define species.

An ordered list of species is maintained.

In each generation, genomes are sequentially placed into species.

Each existing species is represented by a random genome inside the species from the previous generation.

A given genome g in the current generation is placed in the first species in which g is compatible with the representative genome of that species. 

If g is not compatible with any existing species, a new species is created with g as its representative

Organisms in the same species must share the fitness of their niche (explicit fitness sharing).

Therefore, any one species is unlikely to take over the entire population, which is crucial for speciated evolution to work.

The adjusted fitness f' for organism i is calculated according to its distance delta from every other organism j in the population:

f' = f / size_of_the_species

size_of_the_species = sum on all organisms(sh(delta(i,j))

with :
  delta(i, j) the distance between i and j
  sh(x) = 1 if x > delta_limit and sh(x) = 0 if x < delta_limit
     

Every species is assigned a number of offspring in proportion to the sum of adjusted fitnesses f' of its member organisms. 

Species then reproduce by first eliminating the lowest performing members from the population

The entire population is then replaced by the offspring of the remaining organisms in each species.

*** PARAMETERS ***

n = 150 NEAT networks
c1 = 1.0
c2 = 1.0
c3 = 0.4.
delta-limit = 3.0

If the maximum fitness of a species did not improve in 15 generations, the networks in the stagnant species were not allowed to reproduce. 

The champion of each species with more than five networks was copied into the next generation unchanged.

There was an 80% chance of a genome having its connection weights mutated, in which case each weight had a 90% chance of being uniformly perturbed and a 10% chance of being assigned a new random value.

There was a 75% chance that an inherited gene was disabled if it was disabled in either parent.

In each generation, 25% of offspring resulted from mutation without crossover.

The interspecies mating rate was 0.001.

In smaller populations, the probability of adding a new node was 0.03 and the probability of a new link mutation was 0.05. 

In the larger population, the probability of adding a new link was 0.3, because a larger population can tolerate a larger number of prospective species and greater topological diversity.
